# ðŸ”§ Fix Git History (Remove API Key)

The API key is still in your first commit. We need to start fresh. Here's the easiest way:

## Option 1: Force Push (Easiest)

Copy and paste these commands:

```cmd
git push --force origin main
```

If that doesn't work, try Option 2.

## Option 2: Fresh Start (Recommended)

```cmd
:: Remove the old git folder
rmdir /s /q .git

:: Start fresh
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Philosophical Universe Explorer"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/niklas-exitace/philosophical-universe-explorer.git
git push --force origin main
```

## Option 3: If you still get errors

You might need to delete the repository on GitHub and create a new one:

1. Go to: https://github.com/niklas-exitace/philosophical-universe-explorer/settings
2. Scroll to bottom â†’ "Delete this repository"
3. Create a new repository with the same name
4. Then run the commands from Option 2

This will completely remove the API key from your Git history!
